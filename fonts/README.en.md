**NeoDunggeunmo Pro** is a proportional bitmap font based on
[NeoDunggeunmo](https://github.com/neodgm/neodgm).

## Introduction

"Dunggeunmo-kkol" is a public domain bitmap font for DOS designed and released
by Jungtae Kim in 1990s, and it's still widely used in LED sign boards thanks
to its decent design. NeoDunggeunmo is a general-purpose TrueType font with
outline glyphs converted from the bitmap font and some original glyphs which
don't exist in the original font.

NeoDunggeunmo Pro is something beyond NeoDunggeunmo. It breaks free from 8x16
or 16x16 pixels boundaries, and each glyph takes just as much space as it
deserves. And with the kerning feature, which appropriately adjusts spacing
between certain character pairs, NeoDunggeunmo Pro is a versatile pixel font
which can be used anywhere outside terminal emulators.
